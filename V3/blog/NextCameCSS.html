                      HTML is only so helpful. Sure you can "write" a webpage, but
                      you definitely cannot make it look like a webpage at all. Lucky
                      for me, <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> bundled
                      the two together. As such, while learning HTML5 I also got
                      a nice little intro into CSS3. While it wasn't at all a comprehensive
                      intro, it was very nice to understand how CSS interacted with
                      my HTML. Also props to <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
                      for putting a large emphasis on <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.
                      These have BY FAR been the most helpful and most crucial things
                      to learn for designing a nice UX. Everything from a navigation bar
                      and a footer (at least most of the time) to where you display your
                      content relies on div tags.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Of course this intro couldn't have hit on everything. But did
                      it need to? Unlike the various key HTML elements (like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
                      <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags)
                      that Codecademy skipped, they didn't really skip any essential CSS
                      properties. I have yet (but eventually plan to) read the
                      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>
                      documentation for the CSS3 properties. MDN does a great job
                      at making comprehensive documentation for HTML5/CSS3, but there
                      are just too many CSS properties to reasonable read through all
                      of them before getting my feet wet. Thus all the CSS code I
                      used to program my first two websites, I entirely learned from
                      Codecademy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      This CSS knowledge was adequate. My first website I had a little
                      navbar at the top, nothing too fancy or special. The dropdown was
                      kinda clunky and not the best UX design, but it worked. I also had
                      a sidebar that, while barren, nicely closed the page. For my second
                      site, I had a slightly nicer navbar (arguably), incorporated text overlay
                      on images, and the biggest achievement: Multiple Pages. The one thing
                      that Codecamey failed to teach me was how to paginate my website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I casually breezed through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank">videos</a>
                      by the same guy that I referenced for learning <a href="MyPathToLearningWebDevelopment.html">a solid path
                      to becoming a Web Developer</a>. These videos didn't really
                      teach me anything after having gone through the Codecademy tutorial and
                      tinkering around with my own website. However, hidden in one of
                      the videos, I found out something that had always escaped me:
                      How to make multiple pages for your website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      If you are like me and just starting off, here's the tip:
                      Make another HTML file, say page2.html, and code it as if you were making a new
                      webpage entirely. Add the CSS for this new HTML file in your
                      typical main.css (unless you want to link a bunch of CSS files,
                      which may be helpful depending on the type of website you are
                      building. If the style changes depending on the part of the site,
                      you may want to separate the CSS files, but for me, I keep everything
                      in main.css for now). Then in your index.html, wherever you want
                      to reference the other page, simply type <code>&lt;a href="page2.html"&gt;</code>.
                      It really is that easy. The browser will first look in your current working directory
                      for that file, page2.html, so you don't have to specify a path, an http, or anything. Just
                      the file name. Much like linking images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      This was super helpful and allowed me to finally design a nice
                      and impressive <em>Website</em> rather than just a simple
                      <em>Webpage</em>. However, I still wasn't satisfied. I often work
                      split screen, with my browser condensed to the left and my editor
                      to the right, each taking up 50% of the screen. Doing this though
                      fucked up my layout. Everything got shifted and messed up and didn't
                      look nice. I had a website, but it only delivered the proper UX if
                      seen on fullscreen. And it <strong>definitely</strong> would not work on a phone. This
                      bothered me <strong>tremendously</strong>. As such, I next looked
                      into it, and found there is a whole subset of Web Development called
                      <em>responsive design</em>. This then became the highest precedence
                      on my path to becoming a Web Developer.
