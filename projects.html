                                This is a collection and summary of my GitHub public projects. Under each tab, there is a short description of the project and a link to the actual project page.
                                In addition to these projects, I've done freelance development for several people and have done many terminal-side projects that can't really be displayed on the web.
                                If you would like to hear more about either of these latter ventures, please contact me privately and I can forward you my work. Otherwise, enjoy the projects. I'll try to update this regularly.

                                About a year ago, I began toying around with Markov Babblers. Markov Babblers are programs that apply <a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model" target="_blank">Markov Models</a> to long bodies of text, in order to <em>babble</em>, or output semi-coherent sentences.
                                The more text you feed it and the better the model, the more accurate and logical the program's output is.
                            </p>
                            <p class="panel-par">
                                I saw a glimpse of it in a class of mine, and decided to work out the data-structures (my own implemented hash tables) and infrastructure for it. After more tinkering, I established a nice front-end for it in the terminal
                                and finished the actual modeling and babbling aspects of the program. Unfortunately, at the time, I only knew C. As such, I had a robust Markov Babbler that could only be run in the terminal.
                            </p>
                            <p class="panel-par">
                                After learning Web Development -- specifically javascript -- I decided to try to create a client-side Markov Babbler.  It uses all the same logic and technologies as before, but now can be readily displayed in a
                                front-end webpage. I decided to take a young, childish theme to the page, because it is a juvenile game that interests the inner kid in me. Plus, it was my first real self-driven project in CS outside of a classroom,
                                so it is like my childish first project as well. Both the C code and JS code is available in my GitHub repo.

                                Since moving out to Chicago, I have become a real foodie. I love the new cuisine and progressive eateries that Chicago has to offer. As such, I decided that it would be fun
                                to create a blog about my adventures through the Chicago foodie scene. Unfortunately, I have never been big into blogging. I don't like writing a ton about me, my experiences, or my preferences.
                                So I needed a blog that wouldn't be a review like Yelp.

                                I decided to create a map-based blog. I used the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> to create a cute little <em>"blog"</em> that charted my travels around restaurants in Chicago. I think it still counts as a blog, even
                                though there really aren't many words to the page. In addition to it being a fun project playing around with the Google Maps API, I decided to try to take the responsive design into my own hands for the entire page.
                                I usually have used Bootstrap as a crutch in my previous works to get the nice responsive mobile-first layouts and then added a couple tweaks or media queries to put on the finishing touches.
                                This time, however, I went all na-tu-ral. It is 100% my own responsive design -- which turned out to be a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> bitch to deal with the responsive JS. But I am content knowing that if push comes to shove,
                                I can create my own mobile-first responsive sites. Check it out on any and all platforms!

                                So this is my current project. There is not project page for it yet, as the underlying back-end tech is still being developed.

                                My Markov Babbler was tons of fun, but it wasn't really technically challenging enough for me. Nor was it really too satisfying of an end result. Sure getting border-line coherent sentences was cool at first -- mostly because
                                the theory of the Babbler came into fruition and it was my first project -- but afterwards, it isn't really anything that will keep me interested in the page. The tech of the page was interesting, doing everything with AJAX and JS to
                                make the tabs emulate separate pages without changing physical html pages. But I always had a latent idea of a grander, cooler, better application of the Babbler that really does inspire me.

                                I want to make a Rap Generator. I want to tweak my general Markov Babbler to use last-words to pull up next-lines, take into account syllables per line, and (maybe, depending on how technically difficult this is) a database of rhyming schemes per song,
                                in order to output not only coherent, but also rhythmically sound and rhyming hip-hop lyrics. This project so far has been <strong>really</strong> technically challenging, but nonetheless interesting and motivating. And I keep thinking about how incredibly
                                cool the final result will be!
                            </p>
                            <p class="panel-par">
                                So now you know the end-goal. Where am I? Well it turns out that there is a very extensive <a href="http://ohhla.com/all.html" target="_blank">database of all hip-hop lyrics</a>. As such, I had to first learn Python and then develop a Web Scraper to go through the entire online database and pull the lyrics into a new file.
                                I guess I could have asked for a copy of the DB, but I was an eager kid, stoked about the project, so I took the hard route. Anyways, currently I am parsing all of this data to remove chorus tags, meta data, etc from the lyrics. But, the project is in suit.
                                Check up here often and hopefully you'll be able to play around and make your own raps soon enough!
