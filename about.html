                                I am a junior at the University of Chicago studying biology, mathematics, and computer science. I am currently a front-end developer, but also am learning some back-end and iOS development. Feel free to check out my projects and follow-me on various social media. Below is my entire story. It's kind of long, so feel free to read it at will. I just wanted to add it for full disclosure to anyone wanting to know who I am and what I do.

                                I matriculated into University of Chicago as a die hard bio major, interested in genetics, stem-cells, and cancer biology. As such, before enrolling in college, I talked with many industry professionals in order to figure out which courses and which routes I should take to achieve a career in my interests. They all highly recommended having some CS experience on my resume, because those fields are all data-intensive.
                                Me, being me, took this one step further and came into college predetermined to minor in CS. I was always good at math and it interested me, so I kept that around as my second-major. Thus, I began college as a prospective double major with a minor, intending to do biological research.

                                During my first year at college, I began an internship in a cellular oncology lab -- just what I was interested in! After a year in the lab, I already began to notice how slow bench-work was and how tedious actual biological research could be.
                                Concurrently, during my second-year, I embarked on my CS-minor. My intro courses proved to be highly fascinating and my interests quickly shifted gears. I began working harder on my compsci stuff and putting my bio work on the backburner.
                            </p>
                            <p class="panel-par">
                                Here I am today. Still double-majoring in Math and Bio and only minoring in Computer Science; however, I now spend almost all my free time delving into the wonderful world of tech. I have taken extremely interesting and rigorous elective courses in CS, began a rich endeavor into Web Development, and am in the initial stages of a tech-startup.
                                I am versed in emerging technologies, am an active participant in the tech-space and am a member of a large coworking space in Chicago, specifically designed for tech startups. Further, I am now looking towards and applying for tech internships this following summer, instead of my traditional research fellowships in bio labs. I have turned a full 180 and have truly integrated myself into the tech scene.
                            </p>

                                This is not to say that I am <em>flaky</em> on my bio research or that I am just <em>another</em> person who switches majors in college. I am still <strong>extremely</strong> interested in biology. But I have found that a career in research -- a lifestyle living by the bench and embedded into academia -- is too mundane to inspire me.
                                I still love to read the newest papers in Cell and get really into my cool bio courses. But, I just don't get inspired to go to my lab job every day. I don't get passionate about the tedious work of replicating lengthy experiments and the slow process of academic research.
                                At least, not in the same way that I am passionate and driven for tech these days. Nowadays, when I embark on a cool tech project, my mind becomes solely focused on that one task for the next couple of days. Recently, when I began my Markov Babbler in JS project, I spent the next 48 hours constantly working on it, ignoring my homework and other duties because I was so obsessed with the project infront of me.
                                That kind of passion and instant love for my work is what I want to have for the rest of my life. That's why I am now emerging in the tech space instead of continuing with my prior biology work.
