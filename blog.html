                  <p class="blogPostMeta">3 October 2014</p>
                  <p>
                      Last time I ended my blog post talking about how frustrating it
                      is to design a website and then have the layout be completely messed up
                      everytime you shorten the screen width. The solution to this is
                      a practice called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">Responsive Design</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I guess I didn't do my homework well enough, because I found out
                      about responsive design only after taking to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, 
                      a very elegant and widely used framework and templating for Web Design.
                      I know I was supposed to learn Javascript after CSS, but this bugged me
                      so much, that I decided it needed to come first. I had been hearing about
                      Bootstrap for a long time, but wanted to learn the basics first and then
                      build upwards to frameworks (such a UChicago mindset).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After reading through the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
                      documentation and information, I finally realized what responsive mobile-first design
                      is. The main idea is to design your website to be ideal on the smallest screen
                      first. So mobile-device screen widths and smaller have a pleasant UX. Only after that,
                      do you start to think about and design for larger screens. You use media queries such as
                      <code>@media (min-width: 720px)</code> to specify how your CSS layout should appear
                      for larger screens. But it should first and foremost be optimized for small screens.
                      If you do want to display additional or different items on larger screens that don't
                      appear on smaller screens, use <code>display: none</code> appropriately on those
                      elements' CSS. Finally, make sure that your width's and lengths are all in relative terms.
                      In stead of specifying a div's width to 250px, make it 15%. This will allow it to
                      appropriately scale as screen widths are adjusted! Height isn't as big of a deal, but
                      width is <strong>essential</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Luckily, Bootstrap has responsive design embedded and intertwined into its
                      language. A navbar automatically condenses and dropdowns respond accordingly.
                      It makes your life so much easier. Bootsrap 3 was finally made mobile-first,
                      so all of its classes and components that come with the library are enhanced for
                      a nice responsive design. I'd ultimately like to next design a website that
                      is responsive all on my own, but I'll need Javascript for the dropdowns and other
                      things. Practically the only components of my site that are Bootstrap are the
                      Navbar and Footer. But Bootstrap was a very very nice deviation from my learning
                      path, because it finally allowed me to be extremely happy with how my website turned
                      out and allowed me to have a nice and responsive website with little effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I strongly encourage you all to go through and read the Bootstrap documentation
                      thoroughly before using it. It will take one afternoon and after you will have an
                      excellent grasp on the ease of using Bootstrap to <em>dramatically</em> enhance your
                      website. It's a great learning tool to help fine-tune your CSS skills and you will
                      really appreciate it. Just download the files and you'll be all set! No installation
                      or other crazy downloads necessary. Literally just grab their CSS and JS files. Cheers.
                      Next time, I'll be coming to you with some Javascript knowledge hopefully!

                      HTML is only so helpful. Sure you can "write" a webpage, but
                      you definitely cannot make it look like a webpage at all. Lucky
                      for me, <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> bundled
                      the two together. As such, while learning HTML5 I also got
                      a nice little intro into CSS3. While it wasn't at all a comprehensive
                      intro, it was very nice to understand how CSS interacted with
                      my HTML. Also props to <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
                      for putting a large emphasis on <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.
                      These have BY FAR been the most helpful and most crucial things
                      to learn for designing a nice UX. Everything from a navigation bar
                      and a footer (at least most of the time) to where you display your
                      content relies on div tags.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Of course this intro couldn't have hit on everything. But did
                      it need to? Unlike the various key HTML elements (like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>
                      <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags)
                      that Codecademy skipped, they didn't really skip any essential CSS
                      properties. I have yet (but eventually plan to) read the
                      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>
                      documentation for the CSS3 properties. MDN does a great job
                      at making comprehensive documentation for HTML5/CSS3, but there
                      are just too many CSS properties to reasonable read through all
                      of them before getting my feet wet. Thus all the CSS code I
                      used to program my first two websites, I entirely learned from
                      Codecademy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      This CSS knowledge was adequate. My first website I had a little
                      navbar at the top, nothing too fancy or special. The dropdown was
                      kinda clunky and not the best UX design, but it worked. I also had
                      a sidebar that, while barren, nicely closed the page. For my second
                      site, I had a slightly nicer navbar (arguably), incorporated text overlay
                      on images, and the biggest achievement: Multiple Pages. The one thing
                      that Codecamey failed to teach me was how to paginate my website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I casually breezed through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc" target="_blank">videos</a>
                      by the same guy that I referenced for learning <a href="blog/MyPathToLearningWebDevelopment.html">a solid path
                      to becoming a Web Developer</a>. These videos didn't really
                      teach me anything after having gone through the Codecademy tutorial and
                      tinkering around with my own website. However, hidden in one of
                      the videos, I found out something that had always escaped me:
                      How to make multiple pages for your website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      If you are like me and just starting off, here's the tip:
                      Make another HTML file, say page2.html, and code it as if you were making a new
                      webpage entirely. Add the CSS for this new HTML file in your
                      typical main.css (unless you want to link a bunch of CSS files,
                      which may be helpful depending on the type of website you are
                      building. If the style changes depending on the part of the site,
                      you may want to separate the CSS files, but for me, I keep everything
                      in main.css for now). Then in your index.html, wherever you want
                      to reference the other page, simply type <code>&lt;a href="page2.html"&gt;</code>.
                      It really is that easy. The browser will first look in your current working directory
                      for that file, page2.html, so you don't have to specify a path, an http, or anything. Just
                      the file name. Much like linking images.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      This was super helpful and allowed me to finally design a nice
                      and impressive <em>Website</em> rather than just a simple
                      <em>Webpage</em>. However, I still wasn't satisfied. I often work
                      split screen, with my browser condensed to the left and my editor
                      to the right, each taking up 50% of the screen. Doing this though
                      fucked up my layout. Everything got shifted and messed up and didn't
                      look nice. I had a website, but it only delivered the proper UX if
                      seen on fullscreen. And it <strong>definitely</strong> would not work on a phone. This
                      bothered me <strong>tremendously</strong>. As such, I next looked
                      into it, and found there is a whole subset of Web Development called
                      <em>responsive design</em>. This then became the highest precedence
                      on my path to becoming a Web Developer.

                      Clearly the first thing you need to learn to be a Web
                      Developer is how to write HTML. I started this journey
                      by toying around with <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.
                      This ended up being a really helpful start to my learning.
                      Not because it taught me everything I needed to know. Not even
                      close. But because it offers an interactive and easy way
                      to clearly see what you're doing and get a good grasp on how
                      to use HTML initially. It taught me the basics and got me familiar
                      with using headers, paragraphs, divs, etc. This was a good start
                      and allowed me to toy around with my first website (kinda. I had to
                      also take the CSS course, but more on that on the next blog entry).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After toying around with Codecademy and getting a good grasp of
                      designing a website and the programming behind it, I wanted to
                      learn the actual language of HTML itself. Clearly there were
                      elements and attributes that Codecademy breezed over or skipped
                      in its quick (one afternoon of learning) intro. After looking more
                      into it, I found the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>
                      to have really good documentation of HTML5.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      As such, I spent the next couple of days going through each
                      element's page, reading its attributes and understanding
                      it's functionality. This definitely prepared me and made me
                      confident in my physical HTML skills. Next was to learn CSS
                      and build my first website!

                        Near the end of this summer, I finally decided to learn how
                        to program the Web once and for all. After taking a few
                        <a href="http://codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>
                        courses on HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery, I wanted to know
                        the full path of the endeavor I was embarking on. The more I read
                        about Web Development the more confused I got.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is a framework? What is back-end programming? How does Python/C++/languages I've learned
                        through school apply to web programming? What is bootstrap and how
                        do I use it? SASS? LESS? Are all of these things necessary? It seemed like
                        there were a ton of different languages and libraries I had to learn just
                        to code a website and make it do something. I knew there had to be a
                        good explanation of all these things and how they fit together. But it was
                        so hard to find something that easily explained Web Development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, I stumbled on this video, which now shapes and directs how I learn
                        and approach Web Development:
                    </p>
                    <div class='videoEmbed'>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zXqs6X0lzKI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p class="videoAlttext"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXqs6X0lzKI" target="_blank">How to Become a Web Developer</a></p>
                    <p>
                        Afterwards, I developed a schedule of how I would approach learning
                        Web Development. I began with the basics, added in some complexities,
                        and started with Front-End progressing to Back-End. I find it critical
                        to learn the <srong>absolute</srong> basics first and foremost before
                        learning templates and tools. In that regard, I fiddled with websites
                        sin any frameworks before coming to this Bootstrap site. In a later
                        blogpost I will explain my previous endeavors. For now, this is my
                        schedule:

                    <p>
                        I might do some of this out of order (like learning
                        Bootstrap before SASS/LESS or JS) and other such things,
                        but mostly I want to stick to this general outline of learning.
                        If you are in my boat and learning to WebDev and have questions
                        or are an advanced and experienced developer and want to give
                        advice or suggestions, feel free to reach out and contact me!
                        I'm a very chill dude and would love to bestow my knowledge on
                        someone else or receive helpful tips, pointers, and suggestions!

                  about it as well as other things in my life. But it mostly
                  should be Web-Dev/CS oriented.<br>
