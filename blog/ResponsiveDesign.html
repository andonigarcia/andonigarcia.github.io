                  <p class="blogPostMeta">3 October 2014</p>
                  <p>
                      Last time I ended my blog post talking about how frustrating it
                      is to design a website and then have the layout be completely messed up
                      everytime you shorten the screen width. The solution to this is
                      a practice called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank">Responsive Design</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I guess I didn't do my homework well enough, because I found out
                      about responsive design only after taking to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, 
                      a very elegant and widely used framework and templating for Web Design.
                      I know I was supposed to learn Javascript after CSS, but this bugged me
                      so much, that I decided it needed to come first. I had been hearing about
                      Bootstrap for a long time, but wanted to learn the basics first and then
                      build upwards to frameworks (such a UChicago mindset).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After reading through the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
                      documentation and information, I finally realized what responsive mobile-first design
                      is. The main idea is to design your website to be ideal on the smallest screen
                      first. So mobile-device screen widths and smaller have a pleasant UX. Only after that,
                      do you start to think about and design for larger screens. You use media queries such as
                      <code>@media (min-width: 720px)</code> to specify how your CSS layout should appear
                      for larger screens. But it should first and foremost be optimized for small screens.
                      If you do want to display additional or different items on larger screens that don't
                      appear on smaller screens, use <code>display: none</code> appropriately on those
                      elements' CSS. Finally, make sure that your width's and lengths are all in relative terms.
                      In stead of specifying a div's width to 250px, make it 15%. This will allow it to
                      appropriately scale as screen widths are adjusted! Height isn't as big of a deal, but
                      width is <strong>essential</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Luckily, Bootstrap has responsive design embedded and intertwined into its
                      language. A navbar automatically condenses and dropdowns respond accordingly.
                      It makes your life so much easier. Bootsrap 3 was finally made mobile-first,
                      so all of its classes and components that come with the library are enhanced for
                      a nice responsive design. I'd ultimately like to next design a website that
                      is responsive all on my own, but I'll need Javascript for the dropdowns and other
                      things. Practically the only components of my site that are Bootstrap are the
                      Navbar and Footer. But Bootstrap was a very very nice deviation from my learning
                      path, because it finally allowed me to be extremely happy with how my website turned
                      out and allowed me to have a nice and responsive website with little effort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I strongly encourage you all to go through and read the Bootstrap documentation
                      thoroughly before using it. It will take one afternoon and after you will have an
                      excellent grasp on the ease of using Bootstrap to <em>dramatically</em> enhance your
                      website. It's a great learning tool to help fine-tune your CSS skills and you will
                      really appreciate it. Just download the files and you'll be all set! No installation
                      or other crazy downloads necessary. Literally just grab their CSS and JS files. Cheers.
                      Next time, I'll be coming to you with some Javascript knowledge hopefully!
